## Introduction
This Python-based desktop assistant performs various tasks based on user voice commands. It uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture audio from the user and convert it into text, and then uses the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech for the assistant's responses. It also uses various APIs and modules to perform tasks such as sending emails, searching the web, opening files and applications, and more.
